traffic_game
============

A traffic flow game for the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition, 2011.
http://royalsociety.org/summer-science/2011/traffic-control/

Based on Martin Treiber's applet from:
http://www.traffic-simulation.de/

The main difference is that the visualisation is a bit more colorful, and it
includes more explanatory text. I cleaned up a few things in the 'core'
simulation library, but it is mostly unchanged.

Requirements
------------

The game was designed to run on a touch screen at 1920x1080 (that is, 1080p).

The only dependency is Java 6.

To build and run, type
  make

Or you can import this project into Eclipse (www.eclipse.org).
