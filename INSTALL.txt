-- SETUP NOTES FOR GREEN GAME --
   on Windows 7

Fiddle with Main Display Setting
  - Touch screen input is apparently reversed sometimes (that is, touch input on display 1
    affects display 2, and vice versa).
  - Not sure exactly what the patttern is, but switching the main display to the other display
    has fixed the problem for me in the past.
  - Right click on desktop; go to Change Resolution
  - Try making the other monitor the main monitor.
  
Hide the Task Bar in the middle of the two screens
  - Unlock it, set it to autohide, and then drag it to the right edge of the
    left screen (or the left edge of the right screen).
  - This seems to make it invisible, after a short delay.

Disable Screen-Off and Sleep
  - Control Panel > Power Options > Choose when to turn off the display
  - Set to Never display, and Never for sleep

Disable Screensaver (seems to be disabled by default now)
  - Right click on desktop; go to Personalize
  - Screen Saver (bottom right) should say None

Remove Windows logos
  - Right click on desktop; go to Personalize
  - Change Picture location to "solid colors" and choose More... (bottom left)
  - Change to Red 153, Green 204, Blue 0 (zero)

Disable onscreen keyboard
  - Move finger to center left of one of the screens to bring up keyboard.
  - Go to Tools > Options.
  - Uncheck "For touch input, show the icon next to the text box"
  - Uncheck "Use the Input Panel tab"

Disable "Flicks" (gesture input)
  - Go to system tray. Right click on the Flicks icon.
  - Choose "Turn off Flicks"

Disable Multitouch Gestures
  - Control Panel > Pen and Touch > Touch
  - Uncheck "Enable multi-touch gestures and inking"

Disable Press and Hold for right click?
  - Can't seem to do this.

Calibrate Touch Screens
  - Control Panel > Tablet PC Settings > Display 
  - Calibrate for both displays.

Set IE9 home page to blank.
  - Internet options (gear icon in top right).

Tell it not to hide file extensions.
  - this is annoying for development
  - Control Panel > Folder Options > View > Hide file extensions for known types (uncheck)

Set PATH to point to JRE
  - WinKey + Break > Advanced System Settings > Advanced > Environmental Variables
  - Create a new User Variable called PATH with value
%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_26\bin
  - Note: The 64-bit JDK + bundled JRE seems to put the files in these paths;
    the paths may not be the same, depending on how Java was installed (and updates etc.)
