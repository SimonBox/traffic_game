Must have the touch screen set to be the main display.
  - Otherwise input will be mapped to the wrong screen.
  
----------- OLD --------------

Fiddle with Main Display Setting
  - Touch screen input is apparently reversed sometimes (that is, touch input on display 1
    affects display 2, and vice versa).
  - Not sure exactly what the patttern is, but switching the main display to the other display
    has fixed the problem for me in the past.
  - Right click on desktop; go to Change Resolution
  - Try making the other monitor the main monitor.
  
Hide the Task Bar in the middle of the two screens
  - Unlock it, set it to autohide, and then drag it to the right edge of the
    left screen (or the left edge of the right screen).
  - This seems to make it invisible, after a short delay.

Disable Press and Hold for right click?
  - Can't seem to do this.
